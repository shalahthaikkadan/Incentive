# Payroll Processing Web Application

This is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the payroll process by allowing an administrator to upload employee and financial data via spreadsheets, calculate salaries, and manage approvals through a clean, modern dashboard.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Excel/CSV Upload:** Easily upload employee master data, incentives, and deductions using `.xlsx` or `.csv` files.
-   **Multi-File Upload:** Upload multiple incentive or deduction files at once.
-   **Automated Payroll Calculation:** Automatically calculates `Final Salary = Base Salary + Total Incentives - Total Deductions`.
-   **Admin Review Dashboard:** A central place to view all generated payroll results.
-   **Approve/Reject Workflow:** Admins can approve or reject each payroll entry. Rejected entries require a reason.
-   **Data Traceability:** Click on an incentive or deduction total to see a detailed breakdown in a pop-up, including the source file for each entry.
-   **File Viewer:** Click the source file link in the pop-up to open a copy of the original uploaded spreadsheet in a new tab.
-   **Clear Separation of Concerns:** A Django REST Framework backend handles all data logic, while a React frontend provides a responsive user interface.
